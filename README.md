# covid_19_tracker_app_with_flutter

This is a Covid-19 Tracker app developed with flutter and Rest API. The App contains a animated splash Screen and beautifull UI showing the affected countries with count of deaths, affected, recovered and other categories. The figures are get from the "https://disease.sh/v3/covid-19/" This is my first App developed with Rest API.
